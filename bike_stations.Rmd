This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(magrittr)
stations <- readr::read_csv("dat/stations.csv")

colnames(stations)
colnames(stations) <- c("X1","station.id","station.name","latitude","longitude")
names(providers)
leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 18))
m <- leaflet(stations) %>% addTiles() %>% addProviderTiles(providers$MtbMap) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLines,
    options = providerTileOptions(opacity = 0.35)) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLabels) 
m %>% addCircles(color = "red",radius=5, opacity = T ) %>% addMarkers(popup = ~htmltools::htmlEscape(station.name)) 

```


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
